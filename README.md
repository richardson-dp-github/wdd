Wireless Traffic Sensing and Analysis

## Description

This project plans to exploit certain dimensions of wireless sensing and packet analysis.

* WiFi

### Note

* Consider all code here in as a developmental prototype and forgive any imperfections

### Current Work, Status

* Currently, this project is in the status of laying down the groundwork for work that might go in a number of directions.  This groundwork may be almost a repeat of sources found elsewhere.  Sources and references are cited as much as is feasible.
  * Using the scapy package in python to sniff wireless traffic and/or parse a pcap file
  * Converting a scapy packet list into a specified XML file

### Possible Directions this Project Might Take

* Cross-Device Correlation
 * Attribute packets to an individual as opposed to a device or MAC Address
